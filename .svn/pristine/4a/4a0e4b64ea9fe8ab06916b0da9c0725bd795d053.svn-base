Display a banner pointing to sacoronavirus.co.za

== Description ==

As of 26 March 2020, a new regulation was created in South Africa, requiring all websites operating within the .za top level domain name to have a landing page with a visible link to www.sacoronavirus.co.za.
This plugin helps you easily comply with the regulation by adding a discrete, nicely-styled banner on the bottom right-hand side of the page which points to www.sacoronavirus.co.za

From the plugin settings page, you can also adjust the background and font colours to be inline with your websites colour palette if the default colours are not.

**Paragraph 5.1.4 in the Government Gazette 43164:**
*All internet sites operating within .zaDNA top level domain name must have a landing page with a visible link to www.sacoronavirus.co.za*
